CsStrike

CsStrike is a lightweight and straightforward tool developed by CsCrew for testing server stability and bypassing protections such as Cloudflare.

It works by sending thousands of randomized requests using a mix of User-Agent headers, IP spoofing, and various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). The tool can also automatically detect Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

Usage Instructions:

    Install the required dependencies (if you haven't already):
    pip install aiohttp colorama pyfiglet

    Run the script:
    python csstrike.py

    Enter the target URL when prompted:
    https://example.com

The tool will then operate automatically, logging the status of each request in real time.

Important: This tool is intended solely for legitimate penetration testing, security audits, or load testing on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use on other systems is strictly prohibited.

Developed by Adxxmwashere (Adxxm) for CsCrew and for anyone interested in ethical security testing.
